## ABOUT

THERE ARE FEW ARTEFACTS HIDDEN ON DIFFERENT ISLANDS. YOU MUST GO TO EACH OF THEM AND BRING THEM BACK. EACH TIME YOU MUST FIND THE ATEFACT THEN FIND PORTAL ADN GO BACK THRU IT.

ISLANDS ARE PACKED WITH LABIRYNTHS AND TRAPS. MOSTLY TO SLOW YOU DOWN AND CONFUSE. THE ARTEACT IS WELL HIDDEN.

BEST TIMES FOR EACH ISLAND ARE SHOWN. THERE ARE NO LIVES NOR SAVEGAMES. YOU CAN PLAY ANY ISLAND AS MUCH AS YOU WANT. 

### VERSION1

YOU START ON A MAIN ISLAND. PORTALS TO OTHER ISLANDS ARE LOCETED ALL OVER THE PLACE. THE MORE HIDDEN THE PORTAL IS THE HIGHER GAMEPLAY DIFFICULTY IS.

### VERSION2

YOU START IN NA HEAVENS. BASICLY IN THE CLOUD. THERE IS A PORTAL WITH A SIGN WITH REAL DATY OF THE WEEK WRITTEN ON IT. LET'S SAY ~MONDAY~. EACH DAY (IRL) PORTAL WILL CHANGE ITS DESTINATION TO THE NEXT ISLAND. TO WIN THE GAME YOU NEED TO PLAY EACH DAY IN A ROW FOR A WEEK.

### VERSION3-CURRENT

GOAL FOR EACH MAP IS TO FIND ALL THE ARTIFACTS AND OPEN THE EXIT PORTAL IN A LESS AMOUNT OF TIME. AS A BONUS (ADDED POINTS) THERE ARE GOLD AND SILVER ROCKS TO COLLECT.

## IDEAS

PLATFORMER 2.5D? TOMBIDER OR CRASH BANDCOT.

SHADER

FULL SCREEN NOISE. TAKE SCREEN MIX WITH NOISE. ADD DARKER GRADIENT WITH THE MIX - DARKER AREAS GETS MORE NOISE. LIGHTER LESS (BUT STILL). TEST - MIXING CORESPONDING PIXELS FOR FAKE BLUR/BLOOM EFFECT.

EXPERIMENT WITH HOLOGRAPHICS UI. TRANSPARENT TEXT. E.G. OVER THE PORTALS TELLS THE TARGET ISLAND NAME.

LOTS OF HAPPY PARTICLES IF PLAYER BEATS HISCORE FOR GIVEN ISLAND.
